- Add authorization
- Add professions/skills and XP
- Add PvP/combat
- Optimize action ticks (and improve performance when doing bulk)
  - recipes are quite bad for performance, large stacks, can likely try to do one calculation by removing # of ticks \* recipe materials before, then depending on number of possible ticks calculate randomness if needed
